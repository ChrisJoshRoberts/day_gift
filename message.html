    <p>You are the most special person in my life and I am so grateful to
      spend my life with you. <br><br> we have had our fair share of rough
      patches for some time now, but I can really say that lately I have never felt
      more inlove with you than I have now. <br><br> You do so much for me
      and I still feel so lucky that you chose me! <br><br> You are always
      number 1 in my life and I hope you know that.<br><br><br>
      All my love <br> Chris!
